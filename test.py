    Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its 
    simplicity and readability. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released 
    in 1991, Python emphasizes code readability with its notable use of 
    significant indentation. Python supports multiple programming paradigms, 
    including structured, object-oriented, and functional programming. It has 
    a comprehensive standard library and is widely used in web development, 
    data science, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and automation. 
    Python's popularity has grown significantly due to its ease of learning, 
    extensive libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and TensorFlow, and its strong 
    community support.
